    "Interpersonal Communication with StrangersInterpersonal communication with strangers refers to the exchange of information, thoughts, andfeelings between people who do not know each other well. This type of communication commonlyoccurs in daily life, such as when speaking with classmates, coworkers, shopkeepers, serviceproviders, or people met for the first time. Effective communication with strangers requires clarity,politeness, and respect. Since there is little or no prior relationship, first impressions are veryimportant. Simple actions like maintaining eye contact, using a friendly tone, and practicing goodlistening skills help create a positive interaction. Clear language and appropriate body posture alsoreduce misunderstandings. Active listening plays a key role in interpersonal communication. Itinvolves paying attention, avoiding interruptions, and responding thoughtfully. When communicatingwith strangers, asking relevant questions and acknowledging their responses shows interest andrespect, helping build trust quickly. Nonverbal communication is equally important. Facialexpressions, gestures, and personal space can strongly influence how a message is received.Being aware of cultural differences is essential, as gestures and communication styles may varyacross cultures. Safety and boundaries should always be maintained while interacting withstrangers. Personal information should not be shared unnecessarily, and communication shouldremain appropriate and professional. Overall, effective interpersonal communication with strangershelps develop social skills, build confidence, and create positive connections in everyday life.\n",
